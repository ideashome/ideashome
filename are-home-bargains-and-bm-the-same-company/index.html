<p>BM also known as BM Bargains and the larger BM Homestore is a British variety store chain founded in 1978 and incorporated in Luxembourg. BM was acquired by Simon and Bobby Arora in December 2004 from Phildrew Investments at which time the Company traded from just 21 stores. 2010 The business moved into a new head office and modern 620000 square foot distribution centre in Speke Liverpool. It was initially known as Billington Mayman - a name which derived from the man behind the business Malcolm Billington - but was shortened to BM short for Bargain Madness. And if youve always wondered like us whether Home Bargains and Quality Save - which are very similar in branding and price - are indeed the same company the answer is no.</p>
