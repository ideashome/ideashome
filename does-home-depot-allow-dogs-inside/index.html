<p>While Home Depot corporate was unresponsive to my multiple attempts at getting an answer on their national pet policy many of these stores are dog-friendly. Home Depot is one of many hardware stores that are happy to welcome your dog. If pets become aggressive they will be asked to exit the store. All you have to do is ask the service desk when you walk in and they will. Pin By Boompup On Dog Fashion Dog Travel Bag Pet Travel Bag Dog Gear.</p>
