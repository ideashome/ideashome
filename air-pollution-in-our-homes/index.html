<p>Traffic-Related Air Pollution TRAP from motor vehicle emissions may be the most recognizable form of air pollution. In fact some studies show that the indoor air quality in our homes could be 2 to 5 times worse than it is outdoors. Traffic-Related Air Pollution TRAP from motor vehicle emissions may be the most recognizable form of air pollution. So why the rise in pollution in our homes and what can we do. Research features the monitoring and forecasting of wildfire occurrence and distribution.</p>

<p>Inadequate ventilation can increase indoor pollutant levels by not bringing in enough fresh outdoor air to dilute emissions from indoor sources and by not carrying indoor air pollutants out of the home. During the first phase of the study researchers from the University of Leeds will work with 40 families from Bradford in West Yorkshire to measure the level of microplastics caught in sampling devices placed inside their houses. By Marilis Azzopardi VOCs are one class of pollutants that are usually found in higher concentrations inside our homes than in outside air. Even as weve worked to reduce our climate and air pollution by cutting down on vehicle use and using clean fossil free sources for our electricity we continue to use fossil fuels like fossil gas still called natural gas by the gas industry to heat and power our homesraising our greenhouse gas emissions and dirtying our air.
