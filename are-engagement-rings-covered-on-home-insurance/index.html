<p>The majority of standard contents or combined home and contents insurance policies will not cover your engagement ring when you are wearing it outside of your home. Engagement rings are often very valuable objects but whether yours is recent or youve had it for many years it might not be covered by your home insurance. But there is something to keep in mind. For example if you lost a ring which you bought as part of a matching set such as with a necklace and brooch an insurer would generally only cover the estimated value of the ring rather than replace the whole set.
