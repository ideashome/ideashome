<p>Power-line communications technology can use the electrical power wiring within a home for home automation. In this paper the delay of different traffic classes under different network infrastructures and traffic applications have been calculated. The PLC is one of the most widely used wireline communication technology that is based on data transmission over power lines. We extended NS-2 a popular network simulator to model such combined network scenarios. Low voltage electrical wiring has largely been dismissed as too noisy and unpredictable to support high.</p>
